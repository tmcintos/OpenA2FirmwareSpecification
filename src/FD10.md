### <a id="fd10-fd10"></a>FD10 ($FD10)

**Description:**

This routine executes an indirect jump for standard input. It transfers control to the routine whose 16-bit address is in [KSWL/KSWH](#kswl-kswh) (typically [KeyIn](#keyin-fd1b) or `C3KeyIn`). It is functionally identical to [KeyIn0](#keyin0-fd18).

**Input:**

*   **Registers:**
    *   A: N/A
    *   X: N/A
    *   Y: Index register Y, used with BASL for memory access (older ROMs).
*   **Memory:**
    *   [KSWL/KSWH](#kswl-kswh) (address $36-$37): The 16-bit address of the currently active standard input routine.
    *   [BASL/BASH](#basl-bash) (address $28-$29): Base address of the current line, used for indirect memory access (older ROMs).

**Output:**

*   **Registers:**
    *   A: Undefined
    *   X: Undefined
    *   Y: Undefined
    *   P: Flags affected
*   **Memory:**
    *   Modifications depend on the called routine.

**Side Effects:**

*   Transfers control to the input routine specified by [KSWL/KSWH](#kswl-kswh).
*   Side effects are those of the called routine.
