**Description:**

This routine executes an indirect jump for standard input. It transfers control to the routine whose 16-bit address is in [KSWL/KSWH](#kswl-kswh) (typically [KeyIn](#keyin-fd1b) or `C3KeyIn`). It is functionally identical to [KeyIn0](#keyin0-fd18).

**Input:**

*   **Registers:**
    *   A/X/Y: Passed through to the routine pointed to by [KSWL/KSWH](#kswl-kswh).
*   **Memory:**
    *   [KSWL/KSWH](#kswl-kswh) (address $38-$39): The 16-bit address of the currently active standard input routine.

**Output:**

*   **Registers:**
    *   A: Undefined
    *   X: Undefined
    *   Y: Undefined
    *   P: Flags affected
*   **Memory:**
    *   Modifications depend on the called routine.

**Side Effects:**

*   Transfers control to the input routine specified by [KSWL/KSWH](#kswl-kswh).
*   Side effects are those of the called routine.
