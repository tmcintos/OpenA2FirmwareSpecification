## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction

This document provides a detailed technical specification for 8-bit system firmware in the 6502-based Apple II family. It is intended for developers creating compatible software, implementing clean-room ROM versions, or seeking to understand the documented firmware contract. The specification is synthesized from publicly available technical documentation and ROM disassemblies, rephrased for clarity and self-containment.

**Legal Notice:** This specification uses descriptive references to identify the systems and products it documents (referred to as "Apple II family" or by variant names when necessary for clarity). Such references acknowledge the trademark rights of Apple Inc.
